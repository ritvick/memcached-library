#Memcached Library for CodeIgniter

##Description

This library is to help interface between a CodeIgniter based project and 1 or more Memcached Servers ( http://www.danga.com/memcached/ ). It can also be used as a standalone php class with a few tweaks (the data in config/memcached.php needs to be loaded into the $config variable in the constructor).

##Misc 

There has been an issue going on with some people installing (PECL) 'Memcache' and some 'Memcached'. This library can handle either one but **Memcached** is preferred!

##Included

- Library
- Config File
- Controller Example

##How Do I Get Memcached?

You could give http://mrphp.com.au/code/install-memcache-cpanel-running-centos a shot
should work for you regardless of the 'Centos' in the title.
